# Colon cancer detection using vision Transformers (ViT) and explainbale AI
Colon cancer is a type of cancer in the large intestine. It usually starts from noncancerous
growths called polyps. Symptoms include changes in bowel habits, blood in stool, and stomach pain.
Histopathology is the field focused on diagnosing and studying tissue-related diseases by analyzing tissues
and cells through a microscope. This paper introduces a method of identifying colon cancer from
histopathology images through Vision Transformers (ViT) and highlight the cancer regions through
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(GradCAM).Vision Transformers, a cutting-edge approach
harnessing the self-attention mechanism initially designed for transformers in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, are applied for image classification in this study. ViTs involve usage of self
attention mechanism that allows model to focus on relevant regions and features, this is essential incase of
histopathology images for understanding complex pattern in images. ViTs are more suitable for
histopathology image classification because it captures global features effectively by understanding
relationship between all image pixels. This method is compared with 2D Convolutional Neural Network .
This method is highly useful for detecting colon cancer cells in the tissue.
